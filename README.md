## üß† Methodology (Summary)

- **Data Inspection:** Verified dataset shape, data types, and missing values.  
- **Cleaning:** No duplicates or major formatting issues. Minimal type conversions required.  
- **EDA:** Checked distributions, correlations with target (`SalePrice`), and detected numerical outliers.  
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Filled missing values (median, mode, or domain-specific logic).  
  - Encoded categorical variables with `LabelEncoder`.  
  - Scaled numeric features with `RobustScaler`.  
- **Modeling:**  
  - Implemented baseline models.  
  - Tuned a RandomForestRegressor.  
  - Applied cross-validation for evaluation.  
- **Evaluation:** Measured performance with MAE, MSE, and R¬≤. Compared tuned vs baseline.  
- **Optimization:** Applied hyperparameter tuning and feature selection techniques.

## üìä Key Insights

- Certain categorical variables (e.g., **Neighborhood**, **OverallQual**) strongly correlated with housing prices.  
- Outliers were identified in continuous variables like `LotFrontage` and `SalePrice`.  
- Feature engineering decisions (filling missing values domain-specifically) significantly improved model stability.  
- RandomForest with tuned hyperparameters achieved the best performance.
